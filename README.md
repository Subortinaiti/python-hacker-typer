# python-hacker-typer
My version of the website "Hacker typer" made in python.

This was made when i first started to learn python, so it is really bad.

write the text you want to write in the commands.txt file

controls:
escape - quit

F9 - toggle autotype

any key - write



if you want to change the variables, refer to this guide:

typespeed = how many characters are written for each keypress

commandpointer = what should be displayed before the current line

maxloglen = how many lines should be viewed on screen

linespacing = how much are lines separated

autoscrollspeed = useless

cpuinstability = how much randomness should there be in the cpu meter

raminstability = how much randomness should there be in the ram meter



the colors are in RGB
